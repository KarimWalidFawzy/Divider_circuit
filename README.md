# Divider_circuit
This is a mini-project I was working on, a Binary division circuit.
Division is one the most frustrating algorithms to implement using logic gates, so I always wanted to have a division circuit.
This is my approach which uses float numbers as outputs where 32 bits are the integer dividend and 64 bit-precision for the fractional part
